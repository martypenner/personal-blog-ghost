Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`.

Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks.

I wanted to start a blog to help organize my thoughts in a public way, because surely I'm not the only one who can benefit from what I learn. Scott Hanselman talks about wasting your keystrokes:\n\nhttp://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx\n\nI hate waste of any kind, but time especially. So here we go.\n\n## Docker and Digital Ocean <3\n\nAs you may have already determined, I'm running this blog using the ghost blogging platform inside of a [Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerizing/). In case you don't know, Docker is a great way to \"containerize\" your apps, meaning you can define the application's environment alongside your app code. This is super great for ensuring consistency among your teammates, not to mention you avoid polluting your host machine with all kinds of dependencies. I don't know about you, but I hate __globally__ changing PHP + Apache versions, booting redis, installing npm packages, etc. just to satisfy different project requirements (note the emphasis on __globally__; obviously, you'll need to satisfy your project's requirements by using the right tools). Docker is great for providing that much-needed isolation. [See here](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for installation instructions.\n\nTo start, I booted up a Digital Ocean droplet preconfigured with Docker:\n\n![Choosing Digital Ocean Docker droploet](/content/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-03-at-11-39-18-AM-1.png)\n\nNote that I chose the Docker starting point instead of the Ghost droplet in the left column. I did this because I'll be sharing this droplet with other containerized apps, so I wanted to keep the host environment clean and stripped down.\n\nNext, I created a super-simple Dockerfile that looks like this:\n```\nFROM ghost\n```\n\n## Docker Compose for Orchestration\nHere's where things start to get cool. By default, your data is not persisted in a Docker container. Only files you share in what Docker calls a \"volume\" will be persisted. Obviously, I want this blog to live on even if I screw up the container somehow. So of course, I need set up a volume. However, my preference is to go one step further and store persisted data in its own volume container and link it to the app container. For that, a tool called [__Docker Compose__](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (formerly Fig) makes things super easy. Here's my docker-compose.yml:\n```\nghost:\n  build: .\n  ports:\n    - \"8000:2368\"\n  volumes_from:\n    - ghostdata\n  environment:\n    NODE_ENV: production\n \nghostdata:\n  image: busybox:ubuntu-14.04\n  command: \"true\"\n  volumes:\n    - /var/lib/ghost\n```\n\nNote how I'm mapping the host port 8000 to the container port 2368 (Ghost's default port), and using the \"volumes from\" the ghostdata container. And voila! We get persisted data. Note that the data container is using a very small image with a command that executes successfully so the data container is not actually ever _running_. Cool.\n\n[See here](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) for more info on Docker data management.\n\nAt this point, I wanted to start customizing the config.js file Ghost ships with. That was easy enough; just create a config.js in the same host directory as the Dockerfile, and add the current directory as a volume to the ghost container. That looks like this in docker-compose.yml:\n```\nghost:\n...\n  volumes:\n    - ./:/var/lib/ghost\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the ghost container wasn't honouring the volume. I'm not sure if this is a bug in Ghost's build process for the container, or in Docker itself. I need to investigate some more. To get around this, I added config.js explicitly as a volume:\n```\nvolumes:\n  - ./config.js:/var/lib/ghost/config.js\n```\n\nThat worked great.\n\nNext, I started customizing the default casper theme to add prismjs (for syntax highlighting), integration with Disqus, and other tweaks. Rather than copy the whole theme into the host directory, I chose to add individual theme files and add them as explicit volumes, like so:\n```\nghost:\n...\n  volumes:\n    ...\n    - ./themes/casper/post.hbs:/var/lib/ghost/themes/casper/post.hbs\n    - ./themes/casper/default.hbs:/var/lib/ghost/themes/casper/default.hbs\n    - ./themes/casper/partials/loop.hbs:/var/lib/ghost/themes/casper/partials/loop.hbs\n    - ./themes/casper/assets/css/prism.css:/var/lib/ghost/themes/casper/assets/css/prism.css\n    - ./themes/casper/assets/js/prism.js:/var/lib/ghost/themes/casper/assets/css/prism.js\n```\n\nAnd that sums up the config. Now it was time to fire it up! This was as simple as running `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d` in the directory where docker-compose.yml lives. Once I logged in to the Ghost admin and ran through the basic settings, I was happy.\n\n## Supervisord\nFinally, I wanted to ensure the blog would keep running in the event of a container failure or host machine reboot. For that, I installed __supervisord__ on the host machine and added this config:\n```\n[program:marty_blog]\ncommand=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up\ndirectory=/path/to/marty_blog\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\n```\n\nThen I ran `supervisord` to kick things off. Now when I update the blog files or configuration, I can run `docker-compose build && docker-compose stop` and supervisord will take care of restarting the containers. Schawing!\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty happy with the workflow for running this blog containerized. A few hiccups were encountered, but using Docker significantly helped ease the mental burden for me of getting this blog running. Shoot me a comment if you have any questions or corrections, and thanks for reading!\n\n<sub>Note: You may have noticed that I set the host port of the Ghost container to 8000, yet you're accessing this blog on the standard port 80. To accomplish that, I'm actually running an nginx container as a reverse proxy. That's how I'm running multiple apps on the same host with no global clutter. Shoot me a comment if you'd like to know how I configured that.</sub>","html":"<p>May as well start simple, hey?

Here's a very basic example SVG:\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\"><path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M-1-1h202v202H-1z\"/><g><path stroke=\"#040944\" fill-opacity=\"null\" stroke-opacity=\"null\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"#00b9ed\" d=\"M.5.438h199v199H.5z\"/></g></svg>\n\nAfter inspecting the SVG structure using the browser's devtools, I can target the `<path>` element I care about in CSS and modify the `fill` and `stroke` attributes like so:\n\n```css\n<style>\n#arbitrary-id-of-path-element {\n  fill: hsla(335, 52%, 89%, 1);\n  stroke: hsla(335, 52%, 56%, 1);\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThis gives me an SVG that looks like this:\n\n<style>\n#modified {\n  fill: hsla(335, 52%, 89%, 1);\n  stroke: hsla(335, 52%, 56%, 1);\n}\n</style>\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\"><path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M-1-1h202v202H-1z\"/><g><path id=\"modified\" stroke=\"#040944\" fill-opacity=\"null\" stroke-opacity=\"null\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"#00b9ed\" d=\"M.5.438h199v199H.5z\"/></g></svg>\n\nPretty simple! It also allows me to export an SVG from a visual design file and manipulate in the browser. Very cool.","html":"<p>At the <a href=\"https://raceroster.com\">company I currently work for</a>, I've been experimenting with using SVGs to show real-time theme updates as a user changes the theme colours in their branding settings.
